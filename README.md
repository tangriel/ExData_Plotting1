## Exploratory Data Analysis, Assignment 1

This is a repository for the first assignment on Exploratory Data Analysis course.

To see the results you need to do the following:
* download plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R;
* run each of R scripts one by one: you'll get the appropriate png files with plots.

Note: running the first script might take some time as it downloads zip file with the initial data and processes it so that it could be used further. As soon as the file is downloaded and unzipped, it won't do it again in case you don't change the folder where the scripts are located (it checks for 'data' folder and the corresponding zip file in it).
